                <p class="paragraph break-top">Video games are usually organized into different 
                    genres: shooter, side-scroller, platformer, first-person, but what about psychedelic 
                    stimulator? Let’s go back to 1981. In an unassuming arcade in a suburb of Portland 
                    hides a game cabinet with no origin. Hidden in plain sight while teenagers, gamers, 
                    and party-goers ramble around the gaming center; some try the new game and others 
                    pass by it instead. Its existence is inherently mysterious. However, this game wasn't 
                    like any other; it was deadly. Only one release, one name, one identity: Polybius.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="../assets/blog/polybiustitlescreen.png" alt="Polybius." class="break-top" id="polybiusTitle">
                <p class="fine break-bottom toppad">The supposed title screen for Polybius, displayed on coinop.org's page dedicated to Polybius.</p>
                <p class="paragraph bottompad">
                    Not much is known about Polybius. Some articles tell of an addictive state as a side 
                    effect of playing Polybius to the point of severe exhaustion, illness, or even death  
                    <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-urban-legend-of-the-governments-mindcontrolling-arcade-game">[Zarrelli]</a>. 
                    However, there are mainly two conspiracy theories surrounding Polybius. Either:
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">- It was a game developed by the U.S. Government to train individuals 
                    for recruitment into the U.S. military and was possibly part of Project MKUltra.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">OR</p>
                <p class="paragraph">- The game cabinet was invented by a man named Kurt Koller to promote 
                    his website, CoinOp.
                </p>
                <img src="../assets/blog/DeclassifiedMKULTRA.jpg" class="break-top" id="declassifiedMK">
                <p class="fine toppad">One of many declassified MKUltra documents.</p>
                <p class="break baskerville">
                    So, is there any evidence of Polybius’ existence, and which, if any, of these theories 
                    hold up?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">First, an examination of the cabinet is paramount to learning its 
                    secrets. A deep dive is always helpful when researching any topic or subject. Looking 
                    into the Polybius conspiracy theory at first seems very big, but becomes very clear 
                    when examined. There are many things to observe: The supposed connection to MKULTRA, 
                    men in black tinkering around with and eventually taking the cabinet, the alleged 
                    injuries and side effects related to playing the game, mentions of special hardware 
                    incorporated into the game so that it could take control of your mind, etc. However, 
                    as stated earlier, it seems there are only two outcomes to this conspiracy, and there 
                    can only be one true answer in the end.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    While looking at possible evidence of Polybius' existence, it is clear that this game 
                    cabinet is incredibly mysterious. Only a few cabinets at most were released. According 
                    to an article on atlasobscura.com, "Men in black suits opened the machine every week, 
                    recorded its data, and left, with no interest in its coins" and that it eventually 
                    "vanished without warning—taken by the men in black suits, leaving no record of its 
                    existence" <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-urban-legend-of-the-governments-mindcontrolling-arcade-game">[Zarrelli]</a>. The only crumb of evidence that seems to exist is a dark 
                    screenshot of the supposed main menu. Truly, this cabinet is hiding something from us.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Investigating the folklore deeper, we discover that this cabinet is incredibly cruel, 
                    too. In the same article, Natalie Zarrelli claims that the cabinet's players "couldn’t 
                    stop playing, and began acting oddly: they were nauseous, stressed, had horrific nightmares. 
                    Others had seizures or attempted suicide, many felt unable to control their own thoughts" 
                    <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-urban-legend-of-the-governments-mindcontrolling-arcade-game">[Zarrelli]</a>. Here, we realize that the cabinet is not only mysterious but very cruel. 
                    This cabinet wasn't only testing your skills in-game, but your real-world vitality, too.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    This game cabinet was deceitful; a wolf in sheep’s clothing; a diamond in the rough, 
                    but not the kind of diamond you want to find. Even the game’s existence is deceitful. 
                    According to an article on inverse.com, the CoinOp page that listed Polybius “listed 
                    the game as having been copyrighted in 1981 (though no such copyright exists) and only 
                    briefly mentions ‘bizarre rumors’ about the title before classifying its history as 
                    ‘unknown.’” <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.inverse.com/input/gaming/polybius-is-real-video-game-urban-legend">[Houlihan]</a>. The company listed on the title screen, SinneSchloschen, isn’t 
                    a real company. No one knows where it could be or what its gameplay was really like. 
                    This game, along with even its own existence, is deceitful.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    So, is this game even real? Evidence exists supporting both sides of the theory. 
                    Everything about this cabinet was mysterious, cruel, and deceitful. As mentioned before, 
                    the supposed eyewitness accounts testify that the game was real and that it had major 
                    effects on the people surrounding it, but those accounts are almost equally combatted 
                    by the evidence going against them <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-urban-legend-of-the-governments-mindcontrolling-arcade-game">[Zarrelli]</a>. The existence of Project MKULTRA sure 
                    does make this conspiracy theory easier to believe, but Sinneschlochen was never a 
                    company, thus making this situation even harder to decipher. Whether Polybius is said 
                    to be either a deadly game cabinet or a story forged by a keyboard, one thing is 
                    certain: we may never know the truth about Polybius.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    However, a deeper analysis of the two theories stated earlier is needed. The first theory claims that Polybius was created by the U.S. Government. 
                    An article on Atlas Obscura states that players “couldn’t stop playing and began acting 
                    oddly: they were nauseous, stressed, had horrific nightmares. Others had seizures or 
                    attempted suicide, many felt unable to control their own thoughts” 
                    <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-urban-legend-of-the-governments-mindcontrolling-arcade-game">[Zarrelli]</a>. Although 
                    this evidence may be convincing, a question remains: where is all the other evidence 
                    supporting these claims? We only have eyewitness claims, which is helpful, but not enough. 
                    In conclusion, this theory has the potential to hold some ground, but there simply is not 
                    enough evidence to support this theory. To figure out the truth, a deeper search is needed.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph toppad">
                    The second theory states that Polybius was fabricated by a man named Kurt Koller to boost 
                    traffic to his website. Kurt’s website, <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.coinop.org/">coinop.org</a>, 
                    is dedicated to being an archive of old arcade games. On August 3rd, 1998, Kurt created a 
                    completely new post on his website named “Polybius.” In his post, he states that he needs more information about the game cabinet and 
                    that only very little information is known about it <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.coinop.org/Game/103223/Polybius">[Koller]</a>. Scrolling through his post, 
                    he states that he has acquired a ROM of the game. A ROM, or Read-Only-Memory, is a device 
                    used to store data permanently, compared to, for example, RAM, or Random-Access-Memory, 
                    which is volatile and loses its data when the device loses power <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/rom.htm">[Tyson]</a>. A game cartridge 
                    is an example of a ROM and its data cannot be changed, no matter what. The real kicker is 
                    that Kurt’s post about Polybius was last updated in 2009 <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.coinop.org/Game/103223/Polybius">[Koller]</a>. It has been more than 15 
                    years since the post was last updated, and there are no updates, no other confirmed ROMs, 
                    and no other trails of evidence to go down. It’s a dead end. Taking all of this evidence 
                    into account, it’s safe to assume that Polybius is fabricated and not real. In turn, this 
                    theory is now more likely to be true than the first theory.
                </p>
                <img class="break-top" src="../assets/blog/smb3Cartridge.png" alt="" id="smb3">
                <p class="fine break-bottom toppad">A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the NES, an example of ROM(Read-Only-Memory).</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Now that the deeper search is finished, it is safe to say that Polybius is likely fabricated. 
                    There simply is not enough evidence supporting the existence of Polybius and given that Kurt 
                    has been active on the internet since he last updated his post of Polybius with his own personal 
                    website, <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.kurtkoller.com/">kurtkoller.com</a>, there certainly isn’t something sinister about Polybius that 
                    would’ve suddenly made Kurt disappear. The trails vanished, the evidence wained, and the 
                    truth has likely shown itself. Although theory number two seems to be the better choice with 
                    the most evidence, there still is a minuscule chance that Polybius, somewhere, somehow, is 
                    sitting in the back of a facility just waiting to be uncovered. Unfortunately, the truth about 
                    the existence of this incredibly mysterious game cabinet may never reveal itself. However, the 
                    evidence we have now is leaning towards the nullification of a Polybius theory. Polybius, the 
                    world’s most mysterious game cabinet, may just be nothing more than a video game nothing-burger.
